# PostgreSQL Python Data Deployment
This project explores Python as a tool to create databases and tables within PostgreSQL that can later be queried in the PostgreSQL SQL Shell.   

### Included:
- pandas ibrary
- psycopg2 library
- PostgreSQL
- PostgreSQL SQL Shell
  
### Features:
- Ingests data from csv files using the pandas library
- Cleans the data to prepare for insertation into the PostgreSQL database
- Creates a connection to PostgreSQL through the local host, creates a database, creates tables, and inserts the data from the csv files into the created tables

### Learnings:
- Using the psycopg2 library
- Using PostgreSQL
- Querying the PostgreSQL SQL Shell
- Creating databases and tables within Python

### Improvement:
- Expand on the dataset with more complex relational data
- Create a more efficient way to load large amounts of data
- Start with a dataset that needsrigorous cleaning
