  ## About me:
  
I am a professional in the field of Data Analysis with 3+ years of experience visualizing, transforming, and analyzing data. My professional experience mainly comes in the form of SQL querying, excel data manipulation and analysis, and Power BI/Tableau data visualization. 

  ## This Respository:
  
Included in this repository are projects and code intended to demonstrate my Python proficiency and programming interests. Without the opportunity to demonstrate my Python skills professionally, I spend part of my personal time learning and improving my programming skills on my own and this repository currently contains two branches, Analysis and Functions, to do just that. The Analysis branch includes projects and python code where I have used various libraries such as Seaborn and Pandas to visualize and get a better understanding of data sets that I have found online. The Functions branch contains python code intended to explore the automation of things that interest me like stock analysis, movie ratings, and sports scores. The following can currently be found within the two branches: 

### PokeAPI (Functions):
The PokeAPI project was a way to introduce myself to web scraping and using APIs, and the [PokeAPI website](https://pokeapi.co/) was a way to utilize an exisitng API with free, unlimited pulls to practice on. 
	
### Water Pollution/Air Quality (Analysis):
This project was an introduction to the data visualization and analyis capabilities within Python and the various available libraries. Seaborn and Pandas were the two main lirbraries used here.
