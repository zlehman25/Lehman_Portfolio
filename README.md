  ## About me:
  
I am a professional in the field of Data Analysis with 3+ years of experience visualizing, transforming, and analyzing data. My professional experience mainly comes in the form of SQL querying, excel data manipulation and analysis, and Power BI/Tableau data visualization. 

  ## This Respository:
  
Included in this repository are projects and code intended to demonstrate my Python proficiency and programming interests. Without the opportunity to demonstrate my Python skills professionally, I spend part of my personal time learning and improving my programming skills on my own. Branches include projects and python code where I have used various libraries to visualize and understand data sets and explore the automation of things that interest me like stock analysis, movie ratings, and sports scores.
