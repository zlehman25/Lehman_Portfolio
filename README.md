# Water Quality/Air Pollution Analysis
This project was an introduction into data analysis and visualization using python and the libraries within it. The data set was found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patricklford/water-and-air-quality?select=Cities1.csv).

### Included:
- pandas library
- seaborn library
- matplotlib library
  
### Features:
- Adds csv file data into the function by saving it into a variable
- Massages the data into a more 'usable' format for analysis
- Creates a variety of graphs to better understand the data

### Process:

I started by searching for a dataset that was both interesting and relatively simple on Kaggle. After finding the data set mentioned earlier I started by loading the csv data into the program using the pandas library. My main idea when it came to interpreting the data was to look at the data from a 'by country' point of view. Because there are several states, cities, regions for each country, I created dataframes from the full dataset that group the data by country and return a mean of the Water Pollution and Air Quality numbers. The data frames were then used to create graphs that look at the correlation between the two main pollution numbers as well as the top and bottom 10 countries for the pollution numbers.

### Learnings:
- Using the pandas library
- Using the seaborn library
- Using the matplotlib library

### Improvement:
- Create more graphs
- Expand on the graphs that were already created - explore more customization options with the libraries that were used
- Look at the data from a different lens - pollution by city? Region? State? Overall?
